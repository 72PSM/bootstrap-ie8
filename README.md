#Bootstrap 4 for IE8 (Alpha)

Bootstrap 3 drops support for Internet Explorer 8, but you can add it back by simply adding this conditional CSS.

```html
    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries -->
    <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --> 
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
      <link href="/css/bootstrap-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet">
      <script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/html5shiv/3.7.2/html5shiv.min.js"></script>
      <script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/respond/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
```
